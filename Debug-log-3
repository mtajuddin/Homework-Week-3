// In a sentence, explain the behavior you expected. (E.g., "I expected the code to draw 24 lines.")
// In a sentence, explain the observed behavior. (E.g., "The code draws 21 lines.")
// Formulate a hypothesis about what might be causing the mismatch
// Test your hypothesis: what action can you take you determine if your hypothesis is true?
// Was your hypothesis confirmed? If so, fix the issue. If your hypothesis was not confirmed, repeat with a new hypothesis!


//Why are the crosses not repeating?
// Remember that for a nested while loop to run multiple times inside of its parent while loop, 
   one must reset its value to zero in the parent while loop.
   
//Processing is additive. So if I want to create the illusion of a continuous animation I need to redraw everything, every frame.

//At first I put the y underneath the parent while loop but that didn't work
//b-c the y values were incremented and then set to zero when the parent
//while loop ran. So I then put the code to set y and y1 in the nested while
//loop b-c I thought that after the parent while loop ran again then the y and y1 would start a new row with x and x1 being 0.
//This didn't work b-c the x and y coordinates were changing at the same time.
//I then decided that I should put the y = 0 and y1 = 0 outside of the while loop
//I reasoned that this would change the y and y1 value after the x and x1 values which would create the rows
//Fortunately that change worked!
