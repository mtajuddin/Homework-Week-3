// In a sentence, explain the behavior you expected. (E.g., "I expected the code to draw 24 lines.")
// In a sentence, explain the observed behavior. (E.g., "The code draws 21 lines.")
// Formulate a hypothesis about what might be causing the mismatch
// Test your hypothesis: what action can you take you determine if your hypothesis is true?
// Was your hypothesis confirmed? If so, fix the issue. If your hypothesis was not confirmed, repeat with a new hypothesis!


//Why are the crosses not repeating?
// Remember that for a nested while loop to run multiple times inside of its parent while loop, 
   one must reset its value to zero in the parent while loop.
   
//Processing is additive. So if I want to create the illusion of a continuous animation I need to redraw everything, every frame.
